# Poll results consolidation page

Just a simple application to show poll results with graphs.


## General App details

This application uses a custom made and really simple PHP framework. I want to have a long explanation about how it works and how to install it, but I trust you're sufficiently smart to figure it out.

## Changelog

2.1.1 Improved filters in results.

2.1.0 Now the app includes a LayoutHelper to share code and markup across different views. Mobile first approach for styles.

2.0.0 Moved from a one PHP file to MAS microframework. Data now stored in a MySQL database to handle thousands of registers. Added a data import tool.

1.0.0 Initial version
